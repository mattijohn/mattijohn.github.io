The city you live in is the most important for your own survival, but which cities are the most important for winning the game? One way to think about this is to re-frame the question as: “how bad is it if there is an outbreak in this city?” Answering this will help players decide which city to prioritise when treating a disease.\nBogotá is connected to five different cities (Buenos Aires, Sáo Paulo, Miami, Mexico City, and Lima). So an outbreak in Bogotá will result in the yellow infection spreading to five new cities. On the other hand, Santiago is connected to only Lima. So an outbreak in Santiago will lead to only one extra infected city. From this perspective, it feels reasonable to say Bogotá is more important than Santiago.\nIn network analysis the number of links connecting to a node (i.e. a city) is called the degree of that node. Bogotá has a degree of 5 because it connects to five other cities, meanwhile Santiago has a degree of 1. The centrality of a node is an indicator of how important the node is within the network. One measure of centrality is the degree centrality, which simply means ranking the nodes by their degree:\n   Rank City Degree     1 Istanbul 6   2 Baghdad 5   3 Bogotá 5   ⋮ ⋮ ⋮   46 Johannesburg 2   47 Lima 2   48 Santiago 1     Degree centrality  In vs out-degree Cities on boundaries   Betweeness Closeness  ","wordCount":"344","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattijohn.github.io/posts/homeschooling-with-board-games/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matti's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattijohn.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mattijohn.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Matti's Blog (Alt + H)">Matti's Blog</a>
