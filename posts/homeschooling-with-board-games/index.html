I started hoarding wine (who needs toilet paper?). And we play a lot more board games.\nAppropriately, one of those board games is called Pandemic.\nFor those unfamiliar with the game, Pandemic is a co-operative game …\nWhich city is the most important? me: Which city do you think is the most important in the game?\ndaughter: London\nme: Why?\ndaughter: Because we live there!\nBefore we can answer “which city is the most important”, we need to decide what “importance” means. The city you live in is the most important for your own survival, but which cities are the most important for winning the game? The answer to that question will depend on what players are trying to do and what has happened so far in the game. What if there are two cities on the verge of an outbreak (i.e. have three infection cubes), and a player can only treat one of the cities to stop an outbreak during this turn. Which city should the player prioritise in this scenario?\nBogotá is connected to Buenos Aires, Sáo Paulo, Miami, Mexico City, and Lima. So the yellow infection will spread to five new cities if there is an outbreak in Bogotá. On the other hand, Santiago is connected to only Lima. So an outbreak in Santiago will lead to only one extra infected city. From this perspective Bogotá seems more important than Santiago.\nIn network analysis, each city on the board is called a node and the connections between the cities are called a link. The importance of a node within a network is called centrality (think of it as describing which person is always at the centre of the party). There are many ways to define importance, but like in our example above, one way of characterising the centrality/importance of nodes within a network is to rank them by the number of links connecting to each node. The number of links connecting to a node is called it’s degree, so the measure of importance based on the number of links is called degree centrality. In our board game, degree centrality would give us a ranking like:\n   Rank City Degree     1 Istanbul 6   =2 Bangkok 5   =2 Bogotá 5   ⋮ ⋮ ⋮   =5 Johannesburg 2   =5 Lima 2   6 Santiago 1    By this measure of importance, Istanbul is the most important city in the game and Santiago is the least important. However, using degree centrality to measure importance has some limitations.\nFirstly, there are many cities with the same rank because the degree of the nodes in this network are in the range 1 to 6. Looking at the network’s degree distribution, we can see that there are 17 cities with degree 4, all of which would be ranked the same.\n 024681012141618Cities654321Degree  Secondly, centrality is not an accurate indicator of the impact of an outbreak on the outcome of the game. Centrality measures the topological importance of a node, not it’s role within a dynamic system.\n Degree centrality  In vs out-degree?
