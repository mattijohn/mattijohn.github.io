A lot has changed in the last year. I started a new job in April 2020.
My 8-year old daughter started homeschooling. I started hoarding wine (who needs toilet paper?).
And we now play a lot more board games.

Appropriately, one of those board games is called Pandemic.

For those unfamiliar with the game, Pandemic is a co-operative game ...

Which city is the most important?
---------------------------------

_me: Which city do you think is the most important in the game?_

_daughter: London_

_me: Why?_

_daughter: Because we live there!_

Before we can answer "which city is the most important", we need to decide what
"importance" means. The city you live in is the most important for your own survival,
but which cities are the most important for winning the game?

- Degree centrality
    - Cities on boundaries
- Betweeness
- Closeness
